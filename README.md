# gitlab-file-read-exploit
I have written an Arbitrary file read exploit for "GitLab12.8.1". A hackerone bug report was inspired me to write this exploit. To reach the final goal of the attack, the attacker has to follow multiple steps. so, I have written a python script to carry out all these steps as automated task.
